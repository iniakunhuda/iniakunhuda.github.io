## About

An educational iPad app teaching kids about budgeting and how to recognize their wants and needs in a fun and interactive way. Created as a submission to the 2022 Apple Swift Student Challenge by Miftahul Huda in April 2022. **And won Swift Student Challenge 2022 by Apple.**

Help Mom to Grocery is a game for child with age 8-10 years old to help their mom buy some basic needs. They will choose product based shopping notes and their budget from their mom. It inspired from serial at Netflix named "Old Enough!"

Child will learn basic math, how to manage finance, and prioritize things to buy what important first. They'll even get fun virtual prizes for every successful mission. Through this game, I hope the kids can nurture their self-directed-learning mindset.
