Hey there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Miftahul Huda and I am a fullstack developer. I have experience contributing and leading multiple projects such as E-grocery App, Marketplace, Agency, and Super Apps for internal team. I find satisfaction developing digital products that have good performace and have a nice user experience. 

Born and raised in ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Surabaya, Indonesia. Received my bachelor's degree on Informatics at Trunojoyo Madura University. Currently working as a mobile developer, and organized GDG Surabaya & Surabaya Dev.

I started my programming journey in 2016 by learning laravel and codeigniter. I began exploring a lot of things, from web development, mobile developer, and artificial intelligence (AI). Technology is very interesting to me because I can pour my creativity into it.

In 2022, I focused on mobile developer, developing various products using Flutter & SwiftUI (Apple SDK) Since then, I have had the privilege of building software for agencies, startups, and communities.
